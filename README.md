HAI ðŸ˜º <p>
just discovered [LOLCODE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOLCODE) programming language ðŸ™€ and decided to have fun with it ðŸ˜º <p>
there's a [website](http://www.lolcode.org) and [github documentation](https://github.com/justinmeza/lolcode-spec/blob/master/v1.2/lolcode-spec-v1.2.md) ðŸ˜» <p>
i used lci - a LOLCODE interpreter written in C - to run it, just follow the instructions in [website](http://www.lolcode.org) and open the README.md in **/lci** <p> there you can read all about prerequisites and instalation ðŸ˜º
